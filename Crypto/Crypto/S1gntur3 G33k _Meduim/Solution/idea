Summary: This challenge is all about dsa check it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm to solve the challenge you have to do some mathmetical operations.
As we know the signed message equal : s= (k^-1 (H(m)+xr))%q
So we have one equation with one unknown varaiable so all we have to do is make the x (our private key in term and all the known variables in the other term)
s * k = (H(m)+xr) %q
s * k -H(m)=xr %q
x = r^-1 ((s* k)- H(m)) %q
