### CHALLENGE WRITEUP

#Subject: RCE , preg_match bypass
#FLag: CYBERHUB{0H_G0d_I_H4t3_pr3GM4tCh_&_R3g3x_!!}
#HOST-NOTE: you must put `flag` file in `/`  so the player can cat it , update `solve.py` with challenge URL before running the script 

PHP has pcre.backtrack_limit, and the value of it is 1000000 by default.
When the regex matching backtrack more than 1000000 times, the preg_match will return false directly.
(Detail: https://www.php.net/manual/en/pcre.configuration.php)

- quick solution : run `solve.py` to send a post request with padding to break preg_match and get the flag
