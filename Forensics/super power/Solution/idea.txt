in the jpg sof marker (ff c0) some valuses had been change , so the data represintation on the screen had been changed but the imahe data stell in the meta data , you only should changet the data rep info 

to solve : 

(you may need to write a script). 

search for the header ( marker ) : ff c0  << by any hex editor . 


you can find 16 byte if you don't know which one is respinsple for this change you can try to change all the 16 byte one by one . 

search for '1E' in those 16 byte , change it to 'E0' 

note : photoshop can't help on this challenege , you can fix a part to get the full image the use the photoshop to fix the output , or just fix the marker corectly .
